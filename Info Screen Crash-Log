Issue: Worlds crash unexpectedly, crash log points to Information Screens.

Is It Repeatable?: Yes, it repeats itself, I'm unsure of how or why, but it's nothing that I've done. It happens when standing still or moving, not interacting with anything.
Mod/s affected: The Log points at RFTools, IE and a few others.
Known Fix: N/A
